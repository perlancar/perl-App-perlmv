	- No functional changes.

0.602   2020-08-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: low

        - No functional changes.

	- [doc] Add 'use Getopt::Long::Complete' in script/perlmv et al so we

0.601   2020-08-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Allow specifying arguments for code (-a, --arg).

	- Check that module defines $SCRIPTLET.


0.600   2020-08-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Support searching for scriptlet in App::perlmv::scriptlet::* modules.
          In this way, scriptlet code is written as normal Perl code instead of
          inside a string, so it can get checked when loaded. You can also add
          summary/description/tags etc.

        - Add tab completion support.


0.50    2015-11-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Revert previous "fix", $anew becomes undef not because of
	  rel2abs() but because of l_abs_path, apply patch by VLASENKO
	  [RT#108952].


0.49    2015-11-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Warn when rel2abs() fails [RT#108952].

	- Observe DEBUG_KEEP_TEMPDIR instead of DEBUG in test to keep
	  tempdir (also observed by App::fsql, App::depak).


0.48    2015-01-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [Bugfix][dzil] Placed prereq File::MoreUtil in the wrong section
	  [CT].


0.47     2014-05-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR

         - [Bugfix] Use l_abs_path() instead of abs_path() so we can handle
           symlinks to non-existing targets. Also, use File::Spec->rel2abs()
           instead of abs_path() to absolutize new/renamed file, because new
           path might not exist (yet). [RT#101288]


0.46     2014-05-15  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - No functional changes.

         - Replace given/when in test suite to if/else, because it becomes
           experimental in 5.18 [RT#95630].

0.44     2013-04-25  Released-By: SHARYANTO

         - 'perlmv' now uses File::Copy::move() to be able to move files across
           devices. The new script 'perlrename' is added; this one still uses
           Perl's rename().

           la piping.

           now --execute.
